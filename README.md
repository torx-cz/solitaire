### Game description 
The Solitaire is a classic card game know all over the world. Mostly because it's part of built in games in Microsoft Windows.
Game goal is to get all cards to four 'target' stacks (each for one colour). But you can use only moves thats are declared 
in game rules. Our implementation of the game allows to play up to four games at the same time. You can also use an undo 
command that can move you back to start of the game. If you get stuck, the 'help' command will be helpful. You can also save
the game to a file and load it back whenever you want.

### Game rules
Game contains standard pack of 52 cards. Some of them are hidden at the start. 24 cards are hidden in "Pack" in the beginning
and you can see them after move "Flip Pack". After that one of "Pack" card will show on "Stacker" and you can move one card to target
or working stacks. Your goal is to get all cards to target stacks. There is four of target stacks and each of theme accepts 
only cards of same colour. First card on the target stack must bean ace, second must be two, three... up to king. To get it possible
there are seven of the working stacks that you can use for moving cards. If the stack is empty you can put a King of some colour to it. 
On the king you can put a Queen but it must have different colour (recognise red and black cards). Between working stacks you can move
more cards. But from working and target (or otherwise) you can move only one card.
